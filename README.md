# IBM-Project-47924-1660803308
Real-Time River Water Quality Monitoring and Control System
TECHNOLOGY : INTERNET OF THINGS(IoT).
TEAM ID : PNT2022TMID52160
PROJECT DESCRIBTION :
       This system uses different sensors for monitoring the water quality by determining pH,turbidity,conductivity,and temperature. The Arduino controller used will access
      the sensor data. With the use of IoT,the collected data is analyzed and the pollution of water can be investigated by a stringent mechanism.
